# All of the tests for this library require that a SockJS server be running:
#
#     $ node tool/server.js
#
# In order to ensure our code is compatible with the Dart Dev Compiler, all
# tests expect to be run against a pub serve instance:
#
#     $ pub serve test --web-compiler=dartdevc --port=8081
#
# By default, all unit tests will be run in Chrome and the VM:
#
#     $ pub run test
#
# If you have Dart 2.x installed, include the `dart2` preset to exclude tests
# that do not work with Dart 2.x (the feature that is incompatible with Dart 2
# will be removed soon):
#
#     $ pub run test -P dart2
#
# Once Dart 2 is officially released and we start requiring it, we will switch
# to using `build_runner` to run tests (it is more performant and supports
# running a test watcher).
